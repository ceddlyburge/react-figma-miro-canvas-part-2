This repository contains code accompanying a [blog post on how to write a figma / miro style canvas in react and typescript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-figma-miro-style-canvas-with-react-and-typescript/).

This is part 2, where cards can be dragged around a canvas and new cards can be dragged on to the canvas from a tray (but panning and zooming of the canvas are not available).

You can run the code with `npm run dev`

You can view a live demo of the code at https://ceddlyburge.github.io/react-figma-miro-canvas-part-2/
