This repository contains code accompanying a blog post on how to write a figma / miro style canvas in react and typescript.

This is part 2, where cards can be dragged around a canvas and new cards can be dragged on to the canvas from a tray (but panning and zooming of the canvas are not available).

You can run the code with `npm run dev`
